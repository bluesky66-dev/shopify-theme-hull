# 💀 Set Up

### Shopify Storefront Access
1. Enable Private Apps in Shopify
   - Apps > "Manage Private Apps" *(text link in page footer)*
   - Enable Private Apps
2. Create new Private App
   - Apps > Manage Private Apps > "Create private app" 
   - Use your dev email to know when there are issues
   - Allow this app to access your storefront data using the Storefront API.

### Shopify Webhooks
1. Go to "Settings" *(bottom left)* -> "Notifications" -> "Webhooks" *(very bottom)*
2. add the following webhooks:
  - product update - `[your-domain]/api/shopify/product-update`
  - product deletion - `[your-domain]/api/shopify/product-delete`
  
### Shopify Store Theme
Since we're serving our store through a headless environment, we don't want visitors accessing our unused shopify theme. The domain for this is visible during checkout, and is publicly accessible. To silence it, replace your current theme's `theme.liquid` file with the one from this repo, and replace `your_frontsite_domain` with your actual frontsite domain URL **(do not include protocol or trailing slash)**

This will essentially "pass-through" URLs accessed on at your Shopify Store to your true headless environment *(ie. `shop.666.com/products` -> `666.com/products`)*
  
### Sanity
1. `npm install && sanity init` in the `/studio` folder
2. During Sanity's initalization it will warn you, type `Y` and hit `enter`:
```
? The current folder contains a configured Sanity studio. Would you like to reconfigure it? (Y/n)
```
3. When it asks you what dataset configuration to use, go with the `default`
4. Add `localhost` and your `.vercel.app` suffixed domain and any custom domains to your Sanity Project's API origins **(do not give credentials)**

### NextJS (frontend)
1. Clone this repository from your GitHub account with the `use template` button
2. `npm install` in the project root folder on local
3. Create an `.env.local` file in the project folder, and add the following variables:
```
SANITY_PROJECT_DATASET=production
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=XXXXXX
SANITY_API_TOKEN=XXXXXX
SHOPIFY_STORE_ID=XXXXXX
SHOPIFY_API_TOKEN=XXXXXX
SHOPIFY_API_PASSWORD=XXXXXX
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_INTEGRITY=XXXXXX
```
4. Update all the `XXXXXX` values, here's where to find each:
  - `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` - You can grab this after you've initalized Sanity, either from the `studio/sanity.json` file, or from your Sanity Manage dashboard
  - `SANITY_API_TOKEN` - Generate an API token for your Sanity project. Access your project from the Sanity Manage dashboard, and navigate to: "Settings" -> "API" -> "Add New Token" button
  - `SHOPIFY_STORE_ID` - This is your Shopify store ID, it's the subdomain behind `.myshopify.com`
  - `SHOPIFY_API_TOKEN` - Copy the Storefront Access Token you copied from setting up your Private Shopify App. _(Note: This is **not** the Admin API Key, scroll to the bottom where it says "Storefront API" for the correct value)_
  - `SHOPIFY_API_PASSWORD` - Copy the Admin API password from "Apps" -> "Manage private apps" -> [your_private_app].
  - `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_INTEGRITY` - Copy the Integrity hash from "Settings" -> "Notifications" -> "Webhooks" *(very bottom of page)*


# ⚡ Spin Up

### Frontend
`npm run dev` in the project folder to start the frontend locally
   - Your Frontend should be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   
### Sanity
`sanity start` in the `/studio` folder to start the studio locally
   - Your Sanity Studio should be running on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)


# Deployment

### Frontend
This is setup to work seamlessly with Vercel, which I highly recommend as your hosting provider of choice. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to setup your new project, and be sure to **add the same `.env.local` variables to your Vercel Project**

### Sanity
This is an easy one, you can simply run `sanity deploy` from the `/studio` folder in your project. Select a subdomain you want, and your Studio is now accessible from the web. This is where I'll invite the client to manage the project, so they can both add billing info and begin editing content.


# 🤘 Extras/Tips

#### Error: Failed to communicate with the Sanity API
If you get this error in your CLI, you need to logout and log back in again, unfortunately. Simply do `sanity logout` and then `sanity login` to fix.

#### Access your `product_sync` metafields in Shopify without using a plugin
Simply navigate to: `https://[store_id].myshopify.com/admin/bulk?resource_name=Product&edit=metafields.sanity.product_sync`

#### How do I properly hand-off a Vercel project to the client?
While not as easy as Netlify, what I prefer to do is:
1. have the client create their own Vercel account
2. At the time of writing, Github connections can only be connected to one Vercel account at a time, so I have the client create a Github account if they don't already have one, and transfer the project repo to them
3. Delete my dev project from my own Vercel account (this is so the client can utilize the project name and domain you were using during dev)
4. You or the client can now connect their newly transferred Github repo to their own Vercel account!
