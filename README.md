# ðŸ¤˜ Extras/Tips

### Error: Failed to communicate with the Sanity API
If you get this error in your CLI, you need to logout and log back in again, unfortunately. Simply do `sanity logout` and then `sanity login` to fix.

1. Simply navigate to: https://[store_id].myshopify.com/admin/bulk?resource_name=Product&edit=metafields.sanity.product_sync
